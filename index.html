      <ul>
        <li>You, as the contestant on a game show, are presented with three doors.</li>
        <li>Behind two of the three doors are goats, and behind the other door is a new car.</li>
        <li>First, you choose any door at random.</li>
        <li>Then, after you make your initial choice, the game show host opens one of the two remaining doors to reveal
          one of the two goats (the game show host knows where the car is and will never open a door that would reveal
          the
          hidden car).</li>
        <li>Lastly, you are given the option to either stick with your original choice or switch to the other closed
          door.
        </li>
        <li class="last-li">Naturally, you win whatever is behind the door you ultimately choose, which hopefully is a
          new
          car!</li>

      <div id="aboutDialog" title="About the Game">Despite being very simple at its core, the Monty Hall problem is an
        oddly confusing probability puzzle that has confounded people for decades, including some otherwise really smart
        folks who simply don't believe the counterintuitive results. Here, you can play an interactive, simulated
        version of the Monty Hall problem (loosely based on the original version of Let's Make a Deal) as many times as
        you want to try to figure out which strategy works best (and more important, why it works).</div>
